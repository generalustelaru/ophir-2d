    <h2>The Lobby</h2>
    <img src="/lobby-game-states.jpg"
    <h2 id="setup-and-goal">Setup and Goal</h2>
    <p>Visitors will have to select one of the available colors to join. This is a free-for-all state. A player may
        select a
        different color if available. The first player to have selected a color becomes the game owner. The game owner
        may
        reset the session at any time.</p>
    <p>Once you&#39;ve chosen a color, you can start typing in the included chat. As a special command, you can
        currently
        change your player name by typing <code>#name &lt;your name&gt;</code>. You can do this any time during the
        game except after its conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>When the owner is satisfied with the player composition, she may click on <strong>Draft</strong>. This will
        reveal
        the map layout and present several <strong>specialist</strong> cards. Each specialist provides a unique special
        ability, some starting <strong>favor</strong> (an alternate currency), and, usually, a
        <strong>specialty</strong>
        commodity.</p>
    <p>Specialist selection is done in reverse player order. Don&#39;t worry, the game will handle rules 100%. Once
        you&#39;ve clicked a specialist card, you&#39;ll have to click on it again to select it. You can&#39;t change
        your
        mind after that.</p>
    <p>During specialist selection, you can switch between the map and the specialist offer by clicking the bottom
        <strong>show/hide</strong> button.
    </p>
    <p>The map consists of seven sea <strong>zones</strong>, each containing a unique <strong>location</strong>. During
        the
        game, on your turn, after moving there, a location will enable its specific <strong>actions</strong> for you to
        take.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The four commodity locations (the mines, quarry, farms, and forest) provide <strong>gems</strong>,
            <strong>marble</strong>, <strong>linen</strong>, or <strong>ebony</strong>, which you can gather, sell, or
            donate.
        </li>
        <li>The orange house icon is the <strong>market</strong>. There, you can sell your carried commodities for
            <strong>coins</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>The yellow gold ingot icon is the <strong>treasury</strong>. There, you can purchase <strong>gold</strong>
            and
            <strong>silver</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>The blue dome and obelisks icon is the <strong>temple</strong>. The temple receives donations of gold,
            silver,
            and commodities, awarding <strong>victory points</strong> (VP) and <strong>favor</strong> in return.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The two grey <strong>barriers</strong> are blocking access between adjacent sea zones. The separated zones are
        not
        considered to be adjacent. Your ship has a reach of two zones. However, barriers can considerably hinder zone
        access. So take that into account when choosing your specialist.</p>
    <p>When all players have selected a card, the owner may click on <strong>Start</strong> to start the game.</p>
    <p>Upon starting, your <strong>ship</strong> will appear in the map&#39;s center zone as a disc token in your chosen
        color . The token is draggable and it is used to indicate your current location on the map. It&#39;s actual
        position
        is irrelevant as long as it is within the sea zone&#39;s hexagonal boundaries. </p>
    <p>Your goal is to collect as many VP as possible before the end game is triggered. Points are secured via donations
        of
        <strong>gold</strong>(10VP), <strong>silver</strong>(5VP), as well as <strong>commodities</strong>(1-4VP) at the
        <strong>temple</strong>. Leftover gold and silver are also worth 5VP and 3VP, respectively. Finally, favor, then
        coins are compared to break possible ties.
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-play-space">The Play Space</h2>
    <p>Zone Button Areas: To the left of the map, you have, from top to bottom, action buttons for the market, the
        treasury,
        and the temple.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The market area consists of a <strong>market deck</strong> and three <strong>market cards</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Map Area: Around the map, from top left going clockwise, you have information relevant to you on your turn:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the <strong>moves</strong> counter (two blueish wave icons which get discolored as you move)</li>
        <li>the <strong>favor button</strong> (a red seal icon button used for spending one favor to obtain turn
            privileges)
        </li>
        <li>the <strong>end turn button</strong> (a red/green anchor icon button for ending your turn)</li>
        <li>the <strong>undo button</strong> (a circular arrow icon for undoing actions and movements)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Player Area: To the right of the map, you have the <strong>player cards</strong>. Each card displays:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the player&#39;s <strong>influence</strong> swatch (a die face situated left of the card itself)</li>
        <li>the player&#39;s <strong>cargo</strong> capacity and contents (a dark band with a thin red border)</li>
        <li>the player&#39;s specialist info button (a clickable white/black band that switches to a description of the
            chosen specialist)</li>
        <li>the player&#39;s favor and coins swatches (red seal and silver coin icons depicting how much the player has
            of
            each)</li>
        <li>the VP swatch (a victory icon showing your accumulated VP; Appears on your card only)</li>
        <li>the specialty icon/button (displays the specialty associated with the player&#39;s chosen specialist;
            Clickable
            on your card only)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Location Area: The section to the left of the map depicts information and the possible actions available at (from
        top
        to bottom) market, treasury, and temple, which are explained further down.</p>
    <p>The following is a detailed explanation of the rules and gameplay.</p>
    <h2 id="turns">Turns</h2>
    <p>Starting with the first player, players will take turns moving and taking actions around the map until the end of
        the
        game.</p>
    <p>To pass the turn, you must click the end turn button. The button becomes available as soon as you move or spend
        favor. Your turn can also end abruptly after failing an influence check or if you become idle and play
        companions
        decide to skip you.</p>
    <p>You can undo your movements and actions up until any unrevertible action/movement that involved rolling a die or
        revealing a new market card.</p>
    <p>Any action that cannot be undone will have to be confirmed in a dialog first. The green button will always submit
        an
        action while the white button will only dismiss the dialog.</p>
    <h2 id="game-end">Game End</h2>
    <p>The game can end in two ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The temple receives enough gold and silver donations to complete construction.</li>
        <li>The market deck empties and can no longer supply a full set of trades.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="coins">Coins</h2>
    <p>Coins (appears as a silver coin icon with a value) are the standard currency in the game and are involved in most
        transactions.</p>
    <h2 id="favor">Favor</h2>
    <p>Favor (red seal icon with a value) is a special currency. You can spend it to enable actions and facilitate
        movement,
        among other things. Favor is harder to obtain than coins.</p>
    <h2 id="zone-actions">Zone Actions</h2>
    <p>Each of the seven zones features a specific set of actions that players can take when visiting them. While some
        are
        repeatable, most are limited (can only be taken once per turn). By default, you cannot take the actions of the
        zone
        in which you begin your turn.</p>
    <h3 id="favor-and-actions">Favor and Actions</h3>
    <p> At the start of your turn, you may click once on the favor button to spend 1 favor and gain access to the
        zone&#39;s
        actions. Some specialists benefit more from this.</p>
    <h2 id="moves">Moves</h2>
    <p>You always get 2 moves at the beginning of your turn. You spend them by moving into adjacent zones.</p>
    <h2 id="moving-the-ship">Moving the Ship</h2>
    <p>On your turn, you may move (or attempt to move) up to two times into zones that are highlighted in light blue.
    </p>
    <p>You move by dragging and releasing the ship figure onto an adjacent sea zone. Zones that contain other ship
        tokens
        are not guaranteed to be accessible. When hovering your ship token over such a zone, it&#39;s color will change
        depending on how probable it is for you to succesfully move.</p>
    <p>When you drop your token into such a zone, a dialog will inform you of your chances and ask for confirmation on
        rolling your influence die. Your chances depend on the player with the highest influence that has her ship token
        there.</p>
    <p>Confirming your attempt will still spend a move, then:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a) If your rolled influence value is at least equal to the highest influence there, your move is succesful.
        </li>
        <li>b) If not, you will remain in the same zone, but all players in that zone who&#39;s influence matches the
            threshold will have thier influence value reduced by one.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Failing a roll always costs you the move, but if you run out of moves as the result of a failure, your turn will
        end
        automatically. Always consider this when making your second move (unless the threshhold value is 1, of course).
    </p>
    <p>You can always examine everyone&#39;s influence by looking at the die face next to their player card.</p>
    <h3 id="favor-and-movement">Favor and Movement</h3>
    <p>On your turn, as long as you have moves left, you may click once on the favor button to spend one favor and
        ignore
        the presence of other ships during movement. With favor spent, you can move into occupied zones successfully,
        without making influence checks.</p>
    <h3 id="actions-and-movement">Actions and Movement</h3>
    <p>Whenever you perform a zone action, you lose all your remaining moves. This means that actions never precede
        movement, even after spending favor.</p>
    <h2 id="the-cargo">The Cargo</h2>
    <p>Your ship has a <strong>cargo</strong> capacity of 2 spaces (displayed as a horizontal band on your player card),
        which can hold a single metal or up to two commodities. Players can expand the capacity twice when visiting the
        temple. On your turn, you can click on any item displayed on your cargo band to drop it overboard. You can drop
        as
        many items as you want and whenever you want.</p>
    <p>While you wouldn&#39;t want to drop anything generally, sometimes the contextual value of commodities can change.
        What&#39;s more, action buttons whose effect would bring a new item onboard are disabled if there isn&#39;t
        enough
        room. Remember, gold and silver take up two spaces.</p>
    <h2 id="zone-actions">Zone Actions</h2>
    <h3 id="commodity-zones">commodity Zones</h3>
    <p>Four of the seven zones contain commodities (gems, ebony, marble, or linen). Each one enables the following
        limited
        action:</p>
    <p><strong>Action: Load commodity</strong>: Click on the zone&#39;s commodity icon to pick up 1 of that type. The
        item
        is placed in your cargo hold and is reflected on your cargo band.</p>
    <p>Occasionally, a zone may become depleted of commodities (showing a red X). This occurs when all commodities of
        that
        type have been picked up. However, the action becomes available again as soon as one of those commodities is
        returned to the &#39;bank&#39; (through selling or dropping).</p>
    <p>The supply of each commodity is equivalent to the number of players plus one.</p>
    <h3 id="the-market-zone">The Market Zone</h3>
    <p>The market (orange house icon) provides you with an limited action (Sell Commodities) and one repeatable action
        (Sell
        Specialty Commodity).</p>
    <p>The location provides access to the <strong>market cards</strong> (buttons), featured in the top left of the map,
        which are splayed right from the <strong>market deck</strong>, the latter showing the future market card.</p>
    <h4 id="market-card-anatomy">Market Card Anatomy</h4>
    <p>An assortment of commodities and a coin value is displayed in the center. These depict an exact transaction that
        a
        player can make.</p>
    <p>The small icon with a number on the bottom right shows the card&#39;s potential value in VP and Favor as a temple
        donation.</p>
    <p>A small arrow in the bottom left corner signifies that the standard coin value has been modified. The upwards
        green
        arrow means +1 value and the downwards red arrow -1 value, respectively. These two modifiers are assigned
        randomly
        to the three <strong>market slots</strong> at the start of the game and are not linked to the market cards
        themselves.</p>
    <h4 id="market-zone-actions">Market Zone Actions</h4>
    <p><strong>Action: Sell commodities</strong>: Once per turn, you may click on an available market card to remove the
        required commodities from your cargo and receive the amount of coins depicted. After the transaction completes,
        the
        market cards will <strong>shift</strong> rightwards like so:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The rightmost card is discarded.</li>
        <li>The other two cards shift one slot to the right, losing and/or taking on a new coin value modifier.</li>
        <li>The top card of the market deck becomes available in the first slot.</li>
        <li>A new card is revealed on top of the market deck.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Action: Sell Specialty</strong>: Click on the specialty icon located on your player card to sell one
        commodity of that type from your cargo and receive 1 coin. You may repeat this as long as you have commodities
        of
        that type in your cargo.</p>
    <p>Important to note:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A market card is only discarded if it&#39;s the rightmost one during the market shift, not because a player
            clicked on it.</li>
        <li>The market deck has the letter &quot;A&quot; displayed near the bottom left. This means that it&#39;s topped
            with &quot;A&quot; cards. When enough cards have been drawn, the &quot;A&quot; will change to a
            &quot;B&quot;.
            This means that better deals will start popping up.</li>
        <li>A consistent market shift due to the Sell commodities action will eventually drain the deck, which will end
            the
            game.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="the-treasury-zone">The Treasury Zone</h3>
    <p>The treasury (gold ingot icon) provides one repeatable action in several &#39;flavors&#39;.</p>
    <p>The location enables the four treasury cards (buttons), featured in a row just under the market deck and cards.
        Here,
        players can trade coins or favor for gold or silver.</p>
    <h4 id="treasury-zone-action">Treasury Zone Action</h4>
    <p><strong>Action: Buy Metals</strong>: Click on a treasury card to deduct the depicted coin or favor amount and
        load
        the depicted metal.</p>
    <p>Important to note:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This action is repeatable but can only be performed twice per turn. While this limitation might seem
            superfluous
            given the cargo capacity, it is to prevent a specialist ability exploit.</li>
        <li>The coins for metal cards tend to get more expensive as the game progresses, so even if the favor for metal
            seems unreasonable by comparison, it might eventually become a viable option.</li>
        <li>Metal supplies are limited as well (available up to the player count plus one). The appropriate action may
            also
            become unavailable if all metals of that type are currently in players&#39; cargo holds.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="the-temple-zone">The Temple Zone</h3>
    <p>The temple (initially a dark blue edifice icon) is the focal point of the game. Here, players can donate metals
        for
        points and commodities for variable amounts of points and favor.</p>
    <p>The location enables the actions depicted in the bottom left area. There are two buttons for donating metal, one
        for
        donating commodities, and one for upgrading your cargo. Tucked in the bottom left corner, a rectangular
        donations
        reference area keeps track of all the donated metals in the game.</p>
    <h4 id="temple-zone-actions">Temple Zone Actions</h4>
    <p><strong>Action: Upgrade Cargo</strong>: Click on the bottom upgrade cargo button to spend 2 coins and increase
        your
        cargo capacity by 1. This action is limited, and can only be performed twice in the entire game (you can only
        increase cargo to 4).</p>
    <p><strong>Action: Donate commodities</strong>: Click to remove the required commodities from your cargo and receive
        the
        amount of VP and favor depicted. Clicking will also shift the market cards.</p>
    <p><strong>Action: Donate Metal</strong>: Click on the gold for VP or silver for VP button to remove the appropriate
        metal from your cargo and gain the associated VP. This action is repeatable, but two conditions are checked each
        time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the donation completed a column (3 metals) in the donations reference area but hasn&#39;t filled it, the
            prices of metal in coins will increase by 0-2 coins.</li>
        <li>If the donation has filled the donations reference area, the temple construction is complete, and the game
            ends
            immediately.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Important to note:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The commodity donation card in the temple area is a direct reference to a market card. One of the three
            market
            slots features a small blue temple icon (above the market card). That is the card being mirrored in the
            temple
            area. Whenever the market shifts, the card that ends up under the temple icon will immediately be referenced
            in
            the temple area.</li>
        <li>Even with the metal price increase, silver will always remain cheaper than gold, at roughly half the cost.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="specialists">Specialists</h2>
    <p>Most of the specialists that players can select at the beginning of the game will break the rules in some way or
        another. Consult their descriptions to familiarize yourself with their potential play style.</p>
    <h2 id="two-player-games">Two-player games</h2>
    <p>When starting a game with two players, a third ship (white) will spawn in the market&#39;s sea zone. This ship
        also
        has an influence die, and may block your movement like any other player ship (trimming its value on failed
        attempts).</p>
    <p>When a player manages to enter the neutral ship&#39;s zone, her turn is paused, gaining control of the neutral
        ship
        figure.</p>
    <p>While controlling the neutral ship, the player must move it once or twice according to the regular movement
        rules, as
        if it had spent favor. After movement, the player must conclude the rival&#39;s turn by either:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a) clicking the bespoke anchor icon next to its card or,</li>
        <li>b) if the ship ended movement at the market zone -- clicking the market card button on the rival card to
            shift
            the market; Then, in either case:</li>
        <li>The neutral ship will roll its influence die</li>
        <li>The player will regain control of her turn</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Important to note:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A player cannot enter the zone containing the neutral ship again after having controlled it on the same
            turn. It
            will appear as restricted.</li>
    </ul>
