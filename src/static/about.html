        <h2>What is Ophir 2D</h2>
        <p>Ophir is a highly tactical pickup & deliver board game for 2-4 players designed by Jason D. Kingsley and
            Charles Wright. It was funded on Kickstarter and released in 2014 by Terra Nova Games (which is now
            defunct).</p>
        <p><bold>Ophir 2D</bold> is a web implementation created as an experiment, for learning, showcasing, and as entertainment.
        </p>
        <h2>What's it about</h2>
        <p>The game puts players in the roles of ship captains. During the game, you will sail between seven island
            locations performing various transactions, from picking up commodities to sales, purchases, and donations.
            The economy features two types of currency: coins and favor. Coins help you increase your cargo capacity,
            while favor enables certain privileges during your turn. Both are good for purchasing gold and silver,
            precious metals that are worth victory points (vp) as donations but also on their own. The goal is to gather
            the most vp before the game ends.</p>
        <p>The tactical challenges vary each time you play. In every new game locations and navigation barriers are
            randomly placed, trading opportunities are randomly sorted, and players pick special abilities from a
            randomized pool.
        </p>
        <h2>How it works</h2>

            observe started games and start new games. You can join and play in multiple games. Returning to the list
            will show you which games have you as a participant and wether they hinge on your input.
