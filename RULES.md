### Setup and goal

At game start, unique locations are randomly assigned to each zone. Two natural barriers are also placed as to restrict passage between adjacent zones.

The Temple (blue location icon) is under construction and requires donations of precious Metals to progress. After every 3rd donation, Metal prices will increase. Once the Temple is complete, the game ends and scores are tallied. Progress on the Temple can be monitored on the botttom left Temple Placard. The number of donations required varies with the number of players.

The game can also end when interacting with the Market (more on that later).

### The Ship

Your Ship has a Cargo capacity of 2 spaces (top left on your Player Card), which can be expanded to 4. On your turn you can click on any carried Cargo item as a Free Action to drop it overboard. You can drop as many items as you want. Careful you don't drop something valuable. Your Ship Figure can be dragged inside its current zone to reposition it. This NOT an Action or Movement. Releasing the Ship Figure on an adjacent zone however will count as Movement towards that zone. You get two Moves each turn (wave icons on the map top left corner). You lose any remaining Moves after performing an Action (except for dropping Items).

### Favor
Favor (depicted as a red seal) is a special resource. You start the game with 2 Favor (the seal with a number on your player card) and may visit the Temple to gain more (up to 6). Favor is a quicker avenue for scoring VP.

### Detailed Movement
On your turn, you must first move once or twice into adjacent zones and without backtracking -- you cannot perform actions in your starting zone.

The two natural barriers are the only elements blocking access. However, opponet ships can also become obstacles. Moving towards a zone where opponents are anchored will require an influence check (roll on a D6) to be succesful.

The roll is performed automatically when you signal intent by releasing your Ship Figure over the destination zone.

   - A roll result of at least equal to the highest influence between the ships there will complete the move succesfully.
   - Rolling lower than the highest influence prevents entry and loses you the move (returning your Ship Figure to its original spot).

If you lost your second move in this manner you also lose your Actions this turn. Wage your chances carefully. Viceversa, your last rolled influence value is retained and might become the threshold for other players wishing to enter your zone. If your influence level prevented an opponent's movement, it will drop by one point.

#### Favor and Movement
On your turn, as long as you have moves left, you may click once on the Favor Icon  (the top-right corner of the map) to spend 1 Favor and either, perform actions at your location even if you have not yet moved (forfeiting movement), or move without making influence checks (ignore opponent ships). This is a powerful ability that can get you out of a tight spot or speed you up in your endeavors.

### Trade Good Locations

Four of the seven zones contain Trade Goods (Gems, Wood, Stone, or Cloth). Location icons depict the Trade Goods themselves.

  - Load Trade Good: Click on the zone's Trade Good Icon to pick up 1 of that type. The Good is placed in your Cargo.

### The Market

The Market (orange house icon location) consists of 3 available Market Cards which shift right after each Market Trade (The Market Placard is displayed in the top left). The deck of Market Cards has the "A" cards sitting on top of the "B" cards. "B" cards contain generally better deals. The leftmost Market Card sits on top of the deck and is not accessbile.

A Market Card features an assortment of Trade Goods that Players can exchange for Coins. When a Player performs a Market Trade Action, the Trade Goods are discarded, the Player receives the Coin amount (pictured in the Coin swatch on the Player Card). Finally all Market Cards will shift rightwards. The first Market Card from the right is discarded, and a new Market Card appears on top of the deck.

The number on the bottom right of a Market Card shows its potential value in VP and Favor (as a Temple donation). If the Market Card shows an arrow in its bottom left corner, it means that its Coin value has been modified. The upwards green arrow means +1 and the downwards red arrow -1 respectively. These two modifiers are assigned randomly to market slots at game start and only affect Market Cards which are placed on them. Hence, the fluctuation of the Coin reward is constant as Market Cards shift to the right.

   - Sell Trade Goods: Once per turn, you may click on an available Market Card to deliver the required Trade Goods from your Cargo for the amount of Coins pictured. Note that the Market Card you picked will drift rightwards and might remain in offer but at a different value.

The game can also end if the market deck runs out, meaning players have focused on trading Trade Goods instead of delivering precious metals.

### The Exchange

The Exchange (gold ingot icon location) is the only source of precious metals (Gold and Silver). The Exchange Placard sits on the left, between the Market and Temple Placards. Here you may perform Exchange Actions to trade Coins or Favor for Gold or Silver. The indicated Coin prices will increase progressively as the Temple levels are added -- Gold increases roughly twice as fast as Silver.

   - Buy Metals: Click on an Exchange Card to trade Coins or Favor for Gold or Silver. You may load two metals if you have the space.  Metal takes up 2 Cargo spaces. Note that you can free up Cargo space by throwing unwanted items overboard.

#### Favor and Metals
The Favor cost of Gold (5) and Silver (3) might look steep. However, as opposed to Coin costs, Favor costs remain constant.

### The Temple

The Temple (blue construction icon) a source of VP and Favor. On the Temple Placard (bottom left) you may perform several Actions:

   - Upgrade Cargo: Once per turn, you may click on the Upgrade Button (bottom right on the Temple Placard) to increase your Cargo capacity by 1 space.
   - Donate Trade Goods: Once per turn you may donate Trade Goods to the temple to get Favor and VP in equal amounts. This donation does not contribute to the construction. The blue Market Card is mirroring a regular Market Card on the Market Placard. The small blue Temple Icon on the upper edge of the Market Placard indicates the slot that's always mirrored on the Temple Placard. Donating Trade Goods will also shift the Market Cards,
   - Donate Metal: Donation Cards are fixed and award 10 VP for Gold and 5 VP for Silver. If you're carrying 2 Metal, you may donate both. The Temple Donations Swatch keeps track of every delivered Metal. The metals stack upwards to 3. When a third Metal is donated, the Coin prices of metals at the exchange increase. Gold price increases roughly by 1 Coin for every completed stack. Silver price increases only half as often. When the swatch fills, the game ends.

### Two player games

When starting a game with two players, a third ship (white) will spawn in the market's sea zone. This ship also has an influence die, and may block your movement like any other player ship (trimming its value on failed attempts).

When a player manages to enter the neutral ship's zone, his turn is paused while he gets in control of the neutral ship.

While controlling the neutral ship the player must move it once or twice according to the regular movement rules, as if it's using favor. After movement, the player must conclude its turn by either: clicking the anchor icon next to its card or -- if the ship ended its movement at the market zone -- clicking the market card icon found on its card to shift the market as if a trade was performed. In either case, the neutral ship will conclude its turn by rolling its influence die.

After concluding the neutral ship's turn, the player resumes his turn. Note that a player cannot enter the zone containing the nutral ship a second time.
