## Setup and Goal

At game start, the map layout is revealed. Each player will now have to select a **specialist**. The specialist provides a unique special ability, some starting **favor** (alternate currency) and, usually, a **specialty** trade good.

Each player will be controling a single **ship** and will begin playing from the center **zone**.

You can switch between the map and specialist offer by clicking the bottom **show/hide** button.

The map is split between 7 sea zones, each containing a randomly-placed **location**. Locations enable specific **actions** to players who **move** into their respective sea zones.
- The four **trade good** locations (the mines, quary, farms, and forest) are sources for **gems**, **marble**, **linen**, and **ebony**, which players can gather, carry, sell, or donate.
- The orange house icon is the **market**. There players can sell their trade goods for **coins**.
- The yellow gold ingot icon is the **exchange**. There players can purchase **gold** and **silver**.
- The blue structure icon is the **temple**. The temple receives donations of gold, silver, and trade goods, awarding **victory points** (VP) and **favor** in return.

The two grey **barriers** are blocking access between adjacent sea zones. The separated zones are generally not considered to be adjacent. Player ships have a reach of two zones, but barriers can alter access between important locations, so take that into account when chosing your specialist.

When all players have selected a specialist. The owner can start the game. When the game starts, new information is revealed:

## Play Space Anatomy
   Zone Button Areas: Left of the map you have, from top to bottom, action buttons pertaining to the market, the exchangee, and the temple.
      - The market area consists of a **market deck** and three **market cards**

   Map Area: Around the map, from top left going clockwise you have turn information relevant to you:
      - the **moves** counter (two blueish wave icons which get discolored as you move)
      - the **favor button** (a red seal icon which changes status when clicked)
      - the **end turn** button (a slanted red anchor icon which becomes straight bright green when clickable)
      - the sun/moon icon (which does absolutely nothing and is misleading at best)

   Player Area: Right of the map you have the **player cards**. Each card displays:
      - the player's **influence** swatch (a die face situated left of the card itself)
      - the player's **cargo** capacity and contents (a dark band with a thin red border)
      - the player's name button (a clickable white/black band that switches to a description of the chosen specialist)
      - the player's favor and coins swatches (red seal and silver coin icons depicting how much the player has of each)
      - the VP swatch (a victory icon showing your accumulated VP; Appears on your card only)
      - the specialty icon/button (displays the specialty associated with the player's chosen specialist; Clickable on your card only)

Following is a detailed explanation of the rules and gameplay.

## Turns

Starting with the last player who picked a specialist, players will take turns moving and taking actions around the map until the end of the game.

To end your turn you must voluntarily click on the end turn button. The button becomes available as soon as you move or spend favor.

## Game End
The game can end in two ways:
   - The temple receives enough gold and silver donations to complete construction.
   - The market deck empties and can no longer supply a full set of trades.

## Coins

Coins (silver coin) are the standard currency in the game and are involved in most transactional actions.

## Favor

Favor (red seal) is a special resource. You can spend it to enable actions and facilitate movement among other things. It comes in short supply compared to coins.

## Zone Actions

Each of the seven zones features specific actions that players can take when visiting them. While some are repeatable, most are expendable (can only be taken once). By default, players cannot take the actions of the zone in which they begin their turn.

### Favor and Actions
 At the start of your turn, you may click once on the favor button to spend 1 favor and gain access to the zone's actions.

## Moves

You always get 2 moves at the beginning of your turn. You spend them by moving into adjacent zones.

## Moving the Ship

On your turn, you may move once or twice or fail doing so.

You move by dragging and releasing the ship figure:
   - Dragging it inside its current zone does not count as moving. You can do that to simply reposition it.
   - Dragging it over into a different zone will:
      - a. highlight the zone as restricted if it's not adjacent, if you're trying to backtrack, or if you're out of moves.
      - b. highlight it as valid and, if other ships are present, display a die face showing the influence threshold you'd need to match to enter it.

When you release your ship over a restricted zone, it will simply move back to where it was displaced. This is not considered movement.

When you release your ship over a valid zone, your move counter will decrease by 1, then:
   - If the zone is vacant, your ship rests where you dropped it, your movement is succesful, and the zone's actions become available.
   - If the zone is occupied you'll first roll your influence *die* (automatically), then:
      - If your new influence value is at least equal to the highest influence between the ships present there, again, your ship succesfully moves and you gain access to the new zone's actions.
      - If your new influence is lower than the highest, then your ship will return to its departure zone and all players that had threshold-level influence in the destination zone will decrease it by 1. Also, if this attempt has expended your second move, you'll lose access to actions you might have gained after your first move attempt.

What to consider before before committing to a move:
   - If the destination's influence threshold is too high, you might want to take another approach, both in terms of movement and actions, especially if you risk losing access to currently available actions (i.e.: your first move was succesful).
   - If a zone has a low influence threshhold, then moving into it might be beneficial, as it's a chance for you to increase your influence value if low. Remember, your influence value can also be a threshold for other players wishing to enter your zone.

You can always examine everyone influence by looking at the die face next to each player card.

### Favor and Movement
On your turn, as long as you have moves left, you may click once on the favor button to spend 1 favor and ignore all other ships during movement. With favor spent, you can move into occupied zones succesfully, without making influence checks.

### Actions and Movement
Whenever you perform a zone action, you lose all your remaining moves. This means that actions never precede movement, even after spending favor.

## The Cargo

Your ship has a **cargo** capacity of 2 spaces (displayed as a horizontal band on your player card) which can hold a single metal or up to two trade goods. Players can expand the capacity twice, when visiting the temple. On your turn you can click on any item displayed on your cargo band to drop it overboard. You can drop as many items as you want and whenever you want.

 While you wouldn't want to drop anything generally, sometimes the contextual value of trade goods can change. Also, action buttons whose effect would bring a new item onboard are disabled if there isn't enough room. Remember, gold and silver take up two spaces.

## Zone Actions

### Trade Good Zones
Four of the seven zones contain trade goods (gems, ebony, marble, or linen). Each one enables the following un-repeatable action:

**Action: Load Trade Good**: Click on the zone's trade good icon to pick up 1 of that type. The item is placed in your cargo hold and is reflected on your cargo band.

In rare occasions a zone may become deplete of goods (showing a red X). That occurs when a fifth good of that type has been picked up. However, the action becomes available again as soon as one of that good is returned to the 'bank' (through selling or dropping).

### The Market Zone
The market (orange house icon) provides 1 expendable action (Sell Trade Goods) and 1 repeatable action (Sell Specialty Good).

The location provides access to the **market cards** (buttons), featured in the top left of the map are splayed right from the **market deck** which shows a future market card.

#### Market Card Anatomy
An assortment of trade goods and a coin value is displayed in the center. These depict the transaction that a player can make.

The small icon with a number on the bottom right shows the card potential value in VP and Favor as a temple donation.

A small arrow in the bottom left corner signifies that the standard coin value has been modified. The upwards green arrow means +1 value and the downwards red arrow -1 value respectively. These two modifiers are assigned randomly to the three **market slots** at the start of the game and are not linked to the market cards themselves.

#### Market Zone Actions
**Action: Sell Trade Goods**: Once per turn, you may click on an available market card to remove the required trade goods from your cargo and receive the amount of coins depicted. After the transaction completes, the market cards will **shift** rightwards like so:
 - The rightmost card is discarded.
 - The other two cards shift one slot to the right, losing and/or taking on a new coin value modifier.
 - The top card of the market deck becomes available in the first slot.
 - A new card is revealed on top of the market deck.

**Action: Sell Specialty Good**: Click on the specialty icon located on your player card to sell one good of that type from your cargo and receive 1 coin. You may repeat this as long you have a good of that type in your cargo.

Important to note:
   - A market card is only discarded if it's the rightmost one during the Sell Trade Goods market shift, not because a player clicked on it.
   - The market deck has the letter "A" displayed near the bottom left. The means that market deck is topped with "A" cards. When enough cards have been drawn, the "A" will change to a "B". This means that better deals will start become avaliable.
   - A consistent market shift due to the Sell Trade Goods action will eventually drain the deck, which will end the game.

### The Exchange Zone

The exchange (gold ingot icon) provides one repeatable action in several 'flavors'.

The location enables the four exchange cards (buttons), featured in a row just under the market deck and cards. Here players can trade coins or favor for gold or silver.

#### Exchange Zone Action

**Action: Buy Metals**: Click on an exchange card to deduct the depicted coin or favor amount and load the depicted metal.

Important to note:
   - While this is a repeatable action, you can generally perform it up to twice, since metals take two cargo spaces and you can have, at most, four spaces free in your cargo.
   - The coin for metal cards tend to get more expensive as the game progresses, so even if the favor for metal seems unreasonable by comparison, it might eventually become a viable option.

### The Temple Zone

The temple (dark blue edifice icon) is the focal point of the game. Here players can donate metals for points and goods for variable amounts of points and favor.

The location enables the actions depicted on the bottom left area. Threre are two buttons for donating metal, a button for donating trade goods, one for upgrading the cargo, and rectangular donations reference area which tracks all the donated metals in the game.

#### Temple Zone Actions

**Action: Upgrade Cargo**: Click on the bottom coin for cargo button to spend 2 coins and increase your cargo capacity by 1. This action is expendable, and can be perfomed twice in the entire game (you can only increase cargo to 4).

**Action: Donate Trade Goods**: Click to remove the required trade goods from your cargo and receive the amount of VP and favor depicted. Clicking will also shift the market cards.

**Action: Donate Metal**: Click on either, gold for VP or silver for VP, button to remove the appropriate metal from your cargo and gain the associated VP. The action is repeatable but two conditions are checked each time:
   - if the donation completed a colum (3 metals) in the donations reference area but hasn't filled it, the prices of metal in coins will increase by 0-2 coins.
   - if the donation filled the donations reference area, the temple construction is complete and the game ends immediately.


Important to note:
   - The trade good donation card in the temple area is a direct reference to a market card. One of the three market slots features a small blue temple icon (above the market card). That is the card being mirrored in the temple area. Whenever the market shifts, the card that ends up under the temple icon will immediately be referenced in the temple area.
   - Even with the metal price increase, silver will always remain cheaper that gold, at roughly half the cost.


## Specialists

Some of the specialists players can select at the beginning of the game can break the rules in some way or another.

## Two player games

When starting a game with two players, a third ship (white) will spawn in the market's sea zone. This ship also has an influence die, and may block your movement like any other player ship (trimming its value on failed attempts).

When a player manages to enter the neutral ship's zone, his/her turn is paused and gain control of the neutral ship.

While controlling the neutral ship the player must move it once or twice according to the regular movement rules, as if has spent favor. After movement, the player must conclude its turn by either:
   - a. clicking the bespoke anchor icon next to its card or
   - b. if the ship ended its movement at the market zone -- clicking the market card button on the rival card to shift the market as if a sale or donation took place
   then, In either case:
   - the neutral ship will roll its influence die.
   - the player will re-gain regular control of their turn.

Important to note:
   - A player cannot enter the zone containing the nutral ship again, after having controlled it on the same turn. It will appear as restricted.
